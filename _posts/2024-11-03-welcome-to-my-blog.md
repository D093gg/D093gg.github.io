Greetings from the cyberspace. This is a fresh blog I just started in this autumn. It is going to be a cozy space where I share my moments in life, thoughts, writing and creation, and insights on environmental research, culture, languages, etc.

I hope you find something that resonates with yourself here. My aspiration is to create a place where all of us can learn from each other and explore new ideas together. Feel free to browse through my posts, leave comments, and share your thoughts. 

## Answer to the world
The transcendence and tranquility of Buddhism and Taoism; the engagement and participation in politics and social morality... We exist and grow within great and awe-inspiring cultures. To answer to the world is my philosophy of life.

佛道的出世与超越，德善的入世与参与。我们在伟大而奇幻的文化中成长和存在。我以身处之。
