I am An Lao, currently a master student in Fudan Univ., focusing on emerging contaminants and water quality.

### Why This Field

In the Anthropocene, both the Earth and humanity are undergoing a multitude of unknown transformations. The environment is not only an interdisciplinary science but also a reflection of philosophical thought. We must engage in innovative ways of thinking and develop new tools to identify and address emerging challenges. This endeavor spans various areas, including chemistry, geoscience, ecology, biology, and sociology. By starting with specific problems and then broadening our perspective, interdisciplinary research consistently fuels my passion.

In contemporary society, we are confronted with a myriad of bizarre imbalances. Pollutants continuously emerge from human activities, traveling travels unknown to us within the environment. I possess a deep curiosity about every aspect of this complex process, which is precisely what we need to explore.

### Hobbies and Other Careers

I love wandering in the nature, with a peaceful and energetic mind. I also love doing sports, and I used to skate a lot. I have a passion for Go.

I write poems, where I only care about three things, that are Chinese land, Chinese language and people. Poems are all about pure language, and they are uninterpretable. However, trying to translate is an endeavor that matters. I am preparing my publish my second collections...

I am also a part-time music producer. I play guitar and I write songs, with the lyrics originally from some poetry. Other tracks tend to be without lyrics because I believe music is sufficient in music. I am working on my second album now...

For my own taste, I like british rock, jazz, classic pops, some genres of electronics, and folk music. Most of them are in English, Chinese, Russian and Japanese.

Last, I am dedicated to be a multilingual, surpassing bilingual. I learn with the love for German and Russian literature. French and Arabic are the next.
