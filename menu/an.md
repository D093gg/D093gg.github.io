### Other Careers

#### Writing

I write poems, where I only care about three issues that are Chinese land, Chinese language, and people. While all languages are losing the primitive and instinctive **bond** with our minds, we have to reshape and rebuild it through dicovering and activating the creativity of words. Poems focus on language the purest way, which makes them uninterpretable. But trying to translate still matters, and I will do this. Now I am hoping to publish my second collections.

#### Music

I am a part-time music producer. I play guitar and write songs, most of which with lyrics are derived from poetry, and incorporate a large amount of folk and traditional music forms. The literary quality of these songs is higher. Other tracks explore a purer musical language, awakening people's deep cultural backgrounds and emotions. This is how I am working on my second album, and it will be released around next year.

For my own taste, I like rock, spirit jazz, classic pops, some genres of electronics, and world music. Learning how ro produce, to mix and to master different types of musisc is really interesting as well.

### Hobbies

I love wandering in nature, with a peaceful and inspired mind. I also enjoy sports, especially non-competitive ones. I used to skate a lot and I have a particular interest in Weiqi/Go.

I always not only want to be bilingual but multilingual. I enjoy learning foreign languages and communicating with others. For the preference of German and Russian literature, I am practicing them.

Last but not least, I like reading, widely.
