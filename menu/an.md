I am LAO An, currently a master student in Fudan Univ., focusing on emerging contaminants and water quality.

### Why This Field

In the *Anthropocene*, both the Earth and humanity are undergoing a multitude of unknown transformations. The environment is not only an interdisciplinary science but also a reflection of philosophical thought. We must engage in innovative ways of thinking and develop new tools to identify and address emerging challenges. This endeavor spans various fields, including chemistry, geography, ecology, computer science, and sociology. By starting with specific problems and then broadening our perspective, interdisciplinary research consistently fuels my passion.

In contemporary society, we are confronted with a myriad of bizarre imbalances and inequities. You just need to open your eyes to find more. Pollutants continuously emerge from human activities, traveling through the environment on journeys largely unknown to us. I possess a deep curiosity about every aspect and intersection of this complex process which is precisely what we have to explore.

### Other Careers

#### Writing

I write poems, where I only care about three issues that are Chinese land, Chinese language, and people. While all languages are losing the primitive and instinctive **bond** with our minds, we have to reshape and rebuild it through dicovering and activating the creativity. Poems focus on language the purest way, which makes them uninterpretable. But trying to translate still matters, and I will do this. Now I am hoping to publish my second collections.

#### Music

I am a part-time music producer. I play guitar and write songs, most of which with lyrics are derived from poetry, and incorporate a large amount of folk and traditional music forms. The literary quality of these songs is higher. Other tracks explore a purer musical language, awakening people's deep cultural backgrounds and emotions. This is how I am working on my second album, and it will be released around next year.

For my own taste, I like British rock, spirit jazz, classic pops, some genres of electronics, and world music. Learning how ro produce, to mix and to master different types of musisc is really interesting.

### Hobbies

I love wandering in nature, with a peaceful and inspired mind. I also enjoy sports, especially non-competitive ones, and I have a particular interest in Weiqi/Go.

I always not only want to be bilingual but multilingual. I enjoy learning foreign languages and communicating with others. For the preference of German and Russian literature, I am practicing them. French and Arabic are the next.

Last but not least, I like reading, widely.
